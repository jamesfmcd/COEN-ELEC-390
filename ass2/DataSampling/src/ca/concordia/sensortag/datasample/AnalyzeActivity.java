	 * Called upon successful connection to the Service. Retrieve the recording data from the

	 * 
	 * One issue with the statistics to collect is that the frequency of events can change over
	 * time: events can be coming in quickly at one moment, and then slow down the next. We want to
	 * be able to represent this as an approximate function f(t).
	 * 
	 * The data collected is represented as a discrete function t[n], representing the time `t` of
	 * the `n`th event (steps taken in this example). t[n] is monotonic increasing, since every
	 * subsequent event must occur after the last one, and therefore t[n] is inversible.
	 * 
	 * If we take the inverse function we get n(t), which represents the `n`th recorded sample at a
	 * given time `t` (the function is undefined at `t` for which a sample was not recorded, so n(t)
	 * is only isolated points). If we assume that n(t) contains samples of a smooth continuous
	 * function x(t), then taking the derivative dx/dt would give us the frequency of events as a
	 * smooth continuous function (units of 1/seconds, or events/second if x is in generalised
	 * real-valued events).
	 * 
	 * Let's use the Newton different quotient on consecutive events to get a first-order
	 * approximation of dn/dt:
	 * 
	 * dn/dt = [n(t_2) - n(t_1)] / (t_2 - t_1)
	 * 
	 * This is dn/dt at (t_2 - t_1)/2. Note that t_2 and t_1 are always for CONSECUTIVE events, so
	 * n(t_2) - n(t_1) is always 1.
	 * 
	 * Therefore, we can simplify this to
	 * 
	 * dn/dt = 1.0/(t_2 - t_1)
	 * 
	 * for any two consecutive event times t_2, t_1. This is an approximation of the frequency of
	 * events between event n(t_1) and n(t_2).
